#Time for re-call python babe!
#Loops that let us move through each item in a list, called for loops
#Loops that keep going until we tell them to stop, called while loops
#Loops that create new lists, called list comprehensions

dog_breeds = ['french_bulldog', 'dalmatian', 'shihtzu', 'poodle', 'collie']

for example in dog_breeds:
    print(example)

#A for loop lets us perform an action on each item in a list.
#Using each element of a list is known as iterating.
#Range function

for i in range(3):
    print("Warning")

#Infinite loop
students_period_A = ["Alex", "Briana", "Cheri", "Daniele"]
students_period_B = ["Dora", "Minerva", "Alexa", "Obie"]

for student in students_period_B:
  students_period_A.append(student)
  #students_period_B.append(student)
  print(student)

  #We often want to use a for loop to search through a list for some value
