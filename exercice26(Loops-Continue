#When we’re iterating through lists, we may want to skip some values.
#Let’s say we want to print out all of the numbers in a list, unless
# they’re negative. We can use continue to move to the next i in the list:

#big_number_list = [1, 2, -1, 4, -5, 5, 2, -9]

for i in big_number_list:
  if i < 0:
    continue
  print(i)
