#Antoher Examples of List Comprehension in Python
#Create a new list named double_nums by multiplying
#each number in nums by two.

nums = [4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42]
double_nums = [num * 2 for num in nums]
print(double_nums)

#reate a new list named squares that contains
#the square of every number in this list.

nums = range(11)
squares = [numbers ** 2 for numbers in nums]
print(squares)

#When using list comprehension, sometimes the items in the list
#that youâ€™re iterating through will be lists themselves! In these cases, you
#can access multiple items in those sub-lists by using the following syntax

original_list = [[1, 2], [3, 4],  [5, 6]] #Two lists
new_list = [item1 + item2 for (item1, item2) in original_list]
print(new_list)

#Create a new list named product that contains the product of
#each sub-list of nested_lists.

nested_lists = [[4, 8], [15, 16], [23, 42]]
product = [item1 * item2 for (item1, item2) in nested_lists]
print(product)
