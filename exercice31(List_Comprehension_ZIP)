#ZIP function
#In the following exercises, you will be given two lists and asked to
#perform operations of corresponding elements of these lists.
#This can be done by using List Comprehension and the built-in Python
#function zip

a = [1, 2, 3]
b = [4, 5 ,6]
combined = zip(a, b)
print(combined)

#Use list comprehension and the zip function to create a new list named
#sums that sums corresponding items in lists a and b. For example,
#the first item in the new list should be 5 from adding 1 and 4 together.

a = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0]
b = [4.0, 5.0, 6.0]
sums = [item1 + item2 for (item1, item2) in zip(a, b)]
print(sums)

#Create a new list named users that contains the string "Name: name,
#Age: age" for each pair of elements in the original lists. 

names = ["Jon", "Arya", "Ned"]
ages = [14, 9, 35]
users = ["Name: "+ name +", Age: "+ str(age) for (name, age) in zip(names, ages)]
print(users)
